### Run in Rstudio server

follow my blog post https://divingintogeneticsandgenomics.rbind.io/post/develop-bioconductor-packages-with-docker-container/


```bash
docker run                                      \
  -e PASSWORD="xyz"                   \
  -p 8282:8787                                \
  wholebrain01062020

```

open web browser, type `localhost:8282`, you will be prompt to type user name and password.
default user name is : `rstudio` and the password is dummy `xyz` in this example.

The home directory of this docker image is `/home/rstudio`, so you may want to mount your local
folders (`github_repo` folder in my home directory in this example) there. 
Also, if you want to install additional R packages, you can mount a directory 
for this.


```bash
mkdir  -p ~/R/wholebrain_docker 

docker run                                      \
  -e PASSWORD="xyz"                   \
  -p 8282:8787                                \
  -v ~/github_repos:/home/rstudio \
  -v ~/R/wholebrain_docker:/usr/local/lib/R/host-site-library \
  wholebrain01062020

```
